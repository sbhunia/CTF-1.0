To solve this problem, I recommended installing kali linux using WSL 2. Then I installed steghide and stegscracker.

This command brute forces the pw list:
stegcracker embed3.jpg Passwords.txt

Once you have the pw you can use this command to get the flag:
steghide extract -sf embed3.jpg -p <pw found in previous step>

This gives you the flag:
MUCTF{babys_brute_force}
